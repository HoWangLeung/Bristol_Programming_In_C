\item If an algorithm uses comparison keys to decide the correct order
then the theoretical lower bound on complexity is $O(n \log n )$. From wiki:

\item Quicksort is so loved by programmers that a library version of it exists in ANSI C.
\item If you need an off-the-shelf sort, this is often a good option.

and so on.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This has a theoretical complexity of $O(n)$.
\item It is difficult to write an all-purpose radix sort - you need a different one for doubles, integers, strings etc.
\item $O(n)$ simply means that the number of operations can be bounded by $k.n$, for some constant $k$.
\item With the radix sort, $k$ is often very large.
\item For many lists this may be less efficient than more traditional $O(n \log n)$ algorithms.

\begin{columns}[T]

\begin{column}{0.40\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item The task of searching for a string amongst a large
amount of text is commonly required in word-processors,
but more interestingly in massive Biological Databases e.g.\ searching for amino acids in protein sequences.
\item How difficult can it be~? Don't you just do a character by
character brute-force search~?
\begin{verbatim}
Master String : AAAAAAAAAAAAH
Substring     : AAAAAAH
Substring     :  AAAAAAH
Substring     :   AAAAAAH
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
\end{column}

\pause
\begin{column}{0.50\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item If the master string has $m$ characters, and the search string has $n$ characters then this search has complexity: $O(mn)$
\item Recall that to compute a hash function on a word we did something like:
\[
h("NEILL") =
\]
{\scriptsize
\[
(13\times26^4 + 4\times26^3 + 8\times26^2 + 11\times26 + 11) \% P
\]
}
where $P$ is a big prime number.
\item This can be expanded by Horner's method to:
{\scriptsize
\[
(((((((13\times26)+ 4)\times26) + 8)\times26) + 11)\times26 + 11) \% P
\]
}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item For a large search string, overflow can occur. We therefore move the {\it mod} operation inside the brackets:
{\scriptsize
\[
((((((13\times26)+ 4)\%P \times26) + 8)\%P \times26) + 11)\%P \times26 + 11) \% P
\]
}
\item We can compute a hash number for the search string, and for the initial part of the master string.
\item When we compute the hash number for the next part of the master, most of the computation is common, we just need to take out the effect of the first letter and add in the effect of the new one.
\item One small calculation each time we move one place right in the master.
\item Complexity $O(m+n)$ roughly, but need to check that two identical hash numbers really has identified two identical strings.

\frametitle{Algorithm : Boyer-Moore String Searching}
\begin{columns}[T]

\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
The Boyer-Moore algorithm uses (in part) an array flagging
which characters form part of the search string and an array telling
us how far to slide right if that character appears in the master and causes
a mismatch.

\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item With a right-to-left walk through the search string we see that the G and the R mismatch on the first comparison.
\item Since R doesn't appear in the
search string, we can take $5$ steps to the right.
\item The next comparison is between the G and the S. We can slide the search string right until it matches the S in the master.

\item Imagine planning a delivery route around a graph, starting from a particular vertex.
\item What's the least cost by which you can visit every vertex without ever returning to one~?
\item Finding the optimal path (to reduce travelling time) is an \verb^NP-hard^ problem - 
read up on Computational Complexity Theory to understand this better.
\item For small graphs you could do this exhaustively, but for very large graphs you have
to use some heuristics.
\item One `greedy' approach is to simply go to your closest unvisited neighbour each time.
