\item Linked data representations are useful when:
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item It is difficult to predict the size and the shape of the data structures in advance.
\item We need to efficiently insert and delete elements.
\end{itemize}
\item To create linked data representations we use pointers to connect separate
blocks of storage together. If a given block contains a pointer to a second
block, we can follow this pointer there.
\item By following pointers one after another, we can travel right along
the structure.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item But would we really code something like this {\bf every} time we
need flexible data storage~? 
\item This would be horribly error-prone.
\item Build something once, and test it well.
\item One example of this is an {\bf Abstract Data Type (ADT)}.
\item Each ADT exposes its functionality via an {\em interface}.
\item The user only accesses the data via this interface.
\item The user of the ADT doesn't need to understand how the data is
being stored (e.g. array vs. linked lists etc.)
