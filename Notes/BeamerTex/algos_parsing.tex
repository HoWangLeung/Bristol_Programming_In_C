\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Several fundamental algorithms have been developed
to recognise legal computer programs (or expressions).
\item These decompose their structure into a form more suitable for processing.
\item This operation, know as parsing, has application
beyond Computer Science, since it is directly related to the study of
languages in general.
\item However, parsing human-friendly expressions is notoriously difficult.
\item Maybe we should write expressions in a machine-friendly way~?
\end{itemize}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item It is a long standing tradition in mathematics to write the operator
between the operands, as in \verb^x+y^, rather than \verb^x y +^.
\item The `normal' method with the operator between the operands is
known as {\it infix} notation.
\item As you scan a traditional infix expression, such as:
\begin{verbatim}
A+B/C+D
\end{verbatim}
from left- to right, it is impossible to tell when you initially encounter the \verb^+^ sign whether or not you should apply the indicated operation to
\item You need to worry about the `/' first since that has precedence.

\begin{columns}[T]

\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item One must probe deeper into the expression to determine whether an operation with a higher priority occurs.
\item This gets very complicated.
\item Brackets make this even worse.
\item The alternative is called {\it Postfix} or {\it Reverse Polish}
after the Polish logician J.\ Lukasiewicz who investigated the
properties of this notation.

Infix~:
\begin{verbatim}
A+B*C
A*B+C
((A+B)*C+D)/(E+F+G)
\end{verbatim}

Reverse Polish~:
\begin{verbatim}
ABC*+
AB*C+
AB+C*D+EF+G+/
\end{verbatim}

\pause
Notice that no brackets are required in Reverse Polish. Therefore, for
simple applications, we could require the user to enter expressions in
postfix form.

\item Reverse Polish may be evaluated by use of a stack.
\item Examine the next character;
\item If it is a number (or variable in the general case)
push it onto the stack.
\item If it is an operator (+-/*), pop off the top two
items, perform the operation and push the result.
\item If we have reached the end the answer is the one and only
item on the stack. Else repeat.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Parsing a program is the process of grammatically analysing how it is composed into parts.
\item Before we can write a program to determine whether a program
written in a given language is legal, we need a description of exactly
what constitutes a legal program.
\item Programming languages are often described by a particular type of
grammar called a {\it context free grammar}.
\item You don't need to understand the input to check if it's valid or not.
